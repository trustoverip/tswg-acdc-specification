## Disclosure mechanisms and exploitation protection
<!-- file name: disclosure-mechanisms-and-exploitation-protection.md -->

An important design goal of ACDCs is to support the sharing of provably authentic data while also protecting against the exploitation of that data. Often, the term privacy protection is used to describe similar properties. However, a narrow focus on privacy protection may lead to problematic design trade-offs. With ACDCs, the primary design goal is not data privacy protection per se but the more general goal of protection from the unpermissioned exploitation of data. In this light, a given privacy protection mechanism may be employed to help protect against data exploitation but only when it serves that more general-purpose and not as an end in and of itself.

### Data privacy

Information or data privacy is defined as the relationship between the collection and dissemination of data, technology, the public expectation of privacy, contextual information norms, and the legal and political issues surrounding them [Information privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy). Data privacy is challenging since it attempts to allow the use of data by 2nd and 3rd parties while protecting personal (1st party) privacy preferences and personally identifiable information (PII). The fields of computer security, data security, and information security all design and use software, hardware, and human resources to address this issue. This definition is consistent with privacy viewed from the perspective of 1st party data rights and the role of 2nd parties in the three-party exploitation model defined below. The Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation’s architecture specification phrases privacy protection as answering the question:
Privacy: will the expectations of each party with respect to the usage of shared information be honored by the other parties?

### Three-party exploitation model 

Sustainable privacy is based on a three-party exploitation model [Sustainable Privacy](https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/SustainablePrivacy.pdf). Fundamentally, the goal is to protect the person (data subject) from exploitation via their personal data. In common usage, exploitation is selfishly taking advantage of someone to profit from them or otherwise benefit oneself. So, any unintended usage by any party is potentially exploitive. Intent is with respect to the person (data subject).

In this model, the 1st party is the person (data subject) of the original data. Their data is 1st party data. A 2nd party is the direct recipient of 1st party data as an intended recipient by the 1st party. A 3rd party is any other party who obtains or observes 1st party data but who is not the intended recipient. 

There are two main avenues of exploitation of 1st party data. These are any 2nd party who uses the data in any way not intended by the 1st party and any 3rd party who uses 1st party data. To clarify, any unintended (unpermissioned) use of 1st party data by any 2nd party is naturally exploitive. 

Moreover, because a 3rd party is defined as an unintended recipient, any use of 1st party data by a 3rd party is likewise, by definition, exploitive. 

Furthermore, 1st party data may be conveyed by one 2nd party to another 2nd party (i.e. shared) in a non-exploitive manner when such conveyance and eventual use by the other 2nd party is intended (permitted) by the 1st party.

To elaborate, exploitation based on disclosure is characterized by a Three-party model. The three parties are as follows:

- First-party = Discloser of data.
- Second-party = Disclosee of data received from First party (Discloser).
- Third-party = Observer of data disclosed by First party (Discloser) to Second party (Disclosee).

Typically, protection from direct 3rd-party (Observer) exploitation without the collusion of the 2nd-party (Disclosee) of disclosed data may be provided by encrypting that data such that only the 2nd-party (Disclosee) may decrypt that data. Encryption is one effective mechanism for protecting the confidentiality of disclosed data from non-collusive 3rd-party observation. The detailed description of such mechanisms that are compatible with ACDCs is beyond the scope of this specification. See [SPAC](https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/SPAC_Message.pdf) and {{TSP}} compatible encryption protocols. 

The primary mechanisms by which 2nd parties (Disclosees) erode the data privacy rights of disclosed data are as follows:
	•	Exploitive use of 1st-party (Discloser) data by 2nd parties (Disclosees).
	•	Sharing of 1st-party (Discloser) data by 2nd parties (Disclosees) with 3rd parties (Observers) either overtly (collusive) or inadvertently (leakage).
