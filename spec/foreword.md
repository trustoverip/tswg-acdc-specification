An Authentic Chained Data Container (ACDC) specification is being incubated at the ToIP (Trust over IP) Foundation [[18]] [[17]]. An ACDC is a compliant external proof format of the W3C VC 2.0 specification.  The ACDC specification supports the use of KERI-based (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) DID methods such as did:KERI and did:webs [[62]] as primary identifiers W3C DID (Decentralized Identifier) specification [[ref: W3C_DID]]. A major use case for the ACDC specification is the use of ACDCs as vLEIs (verifiable Legal Entity Identifiers) [[25]] within the ecosystem and infrastructure developed by [[26]] [[27]] the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation [[24]]. An ISO standard for vLEIs currently is under development at the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).  ACDCs are dependent on a suite of related specifications along with the KERI [[2]] specification. These include Composable Event Streaming Representation [[1]], Self-addressing Identifier [[3]], did:keri [[5]], and Out-of-Band Introduction [[4]]. Some of the major distinguishing features of ACDCs include normative support for chaining, use of composable JSON Schema [[10]] [[39]], multiple serialization formats, namely, JSON [[7]] [[9]], CBOR [[12]] [[13]], MGPK [[14]], and CESR [[1]], support for Ricardian Contracts [[43]],  support for Chain-Link Confidentiality [[44]], a well-defined security model derived from KERI [[2]], Compact formats for resource constrained applications, simple Partial Disclosure mechanisms and simple Selective Disclosure mechanisms. ACDCs provision data using a synergy of provenance, protection, and performance.
